## **Phaser Tutorials**
<br/>

This repository contains several mini games which helped me learn phaser efficiently.<br/>
I have divided each game's code into various sub folders termed as lesson ( Basically checkpoints <img src="BikeGame/Lesson1/assets/images/checkpoint.png" width="20" height="20" />
 )
<br/>


### Installation
Download XAMPP.Clone or download the repo and place it inside htdocs (Which is located inside XAMPP folder)<br/>
Now Double click on XAMPP and start the apache server<br/>
open any browser and type localhost following the file's path <br/>
```
example : http://localhost/BIKE/lesson3/
```


### Note
```
Tutorials are based on phaser version 2.
