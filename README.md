## **Phaser Tutorials**
<br/>

This repository contains several mini games which helped me learn phaser efficiently.<br/>
I have divided each game's code into various sub folders termed as lesson ( Basically checkpoints <img src="BikeGame/Lesson1/assets/images/checkpoint.png" width="20" height="20" />
 )

### Note
```
Tutorials are based on phaser version 2.
